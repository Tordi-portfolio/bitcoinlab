    <h2 class="terms-heading">üìú BitcoinLab Airdrop Terms & Conditions</h2>

    <p class="terms-intro">
      Thank you for choosing <strong>BitcoinLab</strong> ‚Äî a modern, secure, and user-first cryptocurrency wallet platform launched on <strong>June 10, 2025</strong>. As part of our launch celebration, we are excited to offer an exclusive airdrop promotion to all early users. The details and rules of this program are outlined below and must be read and agreed to by every user participating in the airdrop.
    </p>

    <h3>üéÅ Airdrop Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
      The BitcoinLab airdrop campaign runs from <strong>June 10, 2025</strong> through <strong>October 10, 2025</strong>. During this period, all users who register on the platform and successfully fund their wallet will qualify for the airdrop incentive.
    </p>
    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>Users must create an account on BitcoinLab between June 10 and October 10, 2025.</li>
      <li>Users must fund their wallet with any supported cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, USDT, TON, SOL).</li>
      <li>Only actual deposits are eligible for the bonus. Fake or simulated deposits will be disqualified.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üí∞ 5% Daily Growth Incentive</h3>
    <p>
      As part of the airdrop, every user will receive a 5% daily bonus on all deposited amounts. This bonus is credited once every 24 hours and continues until the end of the airdrop campaign on October 10, 2025.
    </p>
    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>The 5% is calculated based on the cumulative deposit balance in your account.</li>
      <li>Bonuses are added automatically to your wallet and are visible in your dashboard.</li>
      <li>If additional deposits are made, the bonus amount increases accordingly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üîí Withdrawal Policy During Airdrop Period</h3>
    <p>
      In order to maintain fairness, prevent abuse, and ensure the integrity of the reward system, withdrawals to external exchanges or wallets will be <strong>temporarily disabled</strong> until the conclusion of the airdrop campaign on <strong>October 10, 2025</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means users will not be able to transfer funds outside the BitcoinLab wallet to any third-party exchanges (e.g., Binance, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc.) until after the airdrop window has closed.
    </p>
    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>Withdrawals to external wallets or exchanges are <strong>disabled until 11:59 PM, October 10, 2025</strong>.</li>
      <li>After this date, all withdrawal functionalities will be fully re-enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üîÅ Internal Transfer Functionality</h3>
    <p>
      While external withdrawals are disabled during the airdrop, BitcoinLab offers a robust <strong>internal transfer system</strong> that allows users to send and receive funds from other registered users within the platform.
    </p>
    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>You may freely trade, send, or receive crypto from other BitcoinLab users using their username or email.</li>
      <li>All internal transactions are processed instantly and recorded in your transaction history.</li>
      <li>There are no transaction fees for internal transfers during the airdrop period.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This feature allows our community to continue trading and utilizing funds while ensuring a controlled environment for the airdrop bonus distribution.
    </p>

    <h3>üìå Important Notes & Compliance</h3>
    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>Accounts suspected of manipulation, spamming, or fraud will be suspended, and their bonuses revoked.</li>
      <li>Users may not create multiple accounts to abuse the airdrop rewards. Each user is entitled to one account.</li>
      <li>The platform reserves the right to update or terminate the airdrop if unexpected security issues arise or in the case of platform abuse.</li>

    <h3>‚úÖ After the Airdrop Ends</h3>
